## Project Overview
This project is a flight map routing application developed as part of the CSC1108 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The application allows users to find flight routes between airports using IATA codes.

## Requirements
To run this project, please refer to the `InstallationGuide.txt` for detailed instructions on setting up the environment and installing necessary dependencies.

## Running the Program
To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:
- python main.py

## How to use the app:
- Run the app and enter the IATA code for your source and destination.
- Press "Search" (it may take awhile to search, depending on your system)
- After Searching, it will display the route on the map.
- Click on "Search Results" to view the results of the Algorithms
- This will also show the Flights (Direct and Connecting) for the chosen source and destionation.
